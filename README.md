Rhabdomancer is a blazing fast IDA Pro headless plugin that locates calls to potentially insecure API functions in
a binary file. Auditors can backtrace from these candidate points to find pathways allowing access from untrusted input.

## Features

* Blazing fast, headless user experience courtesy of IDA Pro 9 and Binarly's idalib Rust bindings.
* Support for C/C++ binary targets compiled for any architecture implemented by IDA Pro.
* Bad API function call locations are printed to stdout and marked in the IDB.
* Known bad API functions are grouped in tiers of badness to help prioritize the audit work.
    * [BAD 0] High priority - Functions that are generally considered insecure
    * [BAD 1] Medium priority - Interesting functions that should be checked for insecure use cases.
    * [BAD 2] Low priority - Code paths involving these functions should be carefully checked.
* The list of known bad API functions can be easily customized by editing `conf/rhabdomancer.toml`.

## Installing

The easiest way to get the latest release is via [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/rhabdomancer):

1. Download, install, and configure IDA Pro (see <https://hex-rays.com/ida-pro>).
2. Download and extract the IDA SDK (see <https://docs.hex-rays.com/developer-guide>).
3. Install LLVM/Clang (see <https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-bindgen/requirements.html>).
4. On Linux/macOS, install as follows:
    ```sh
    export IDASDKDIR=/path/to/idasdk
    export IDADIR=/path/to/ida # if not set, the build script will check common locations
    cargo install rhabdomancer
    ```
   On Windows, instead, use the following commands:
    ```powershell
    $env:LIBCLANG_PATH="\path\to\clang+llvm\bin"
    $env:PATH="\path\to\ida;$env:PATH"
    $env:IDASDKDIR="\path\to\idasdk"
    $env:IDADIR="\path\to\ida" # if not set, the build script will check common locations
    cargo install rhabdomancer
    ```

## Compiling

Alternatively, you can build from [source](https://github.com/0xdea/rhabdomancer):

1. Download, install, and configure IDA Pro (see <https://hex-rays.com/ida-pro>).
2. Download and extract the IDA SDK (see <https://docs.hex-rays.com/developer-guide>).
3. Install LLVM/Clang (see <https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-bindgen/requirements.html>).
4. On Linux/macOS, compile as follows:
    ```sh
    git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/0xdea/rhabdomancer
    cd rhabdomancer
    export IDASDKDIR=/path/to/idasdk # or edit .cargo/config.toml
    export IDADIR=/path/to/ida # if not set, the build script will check common locations
    cargo build --release
    ```
   On Windows, instead, use the following commands:
    ```powershell
    git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/0xdea/rhabdomancer
    cd rhabdomancer
    $env:LIBCLANG_PATH="\path\to\clang+llvm\bin"
    $env:PATH="\path\to\ida;$env:PATH"
    $env:IDASDKDIR="\path\to\idasdk"
    $env:IDADIR="\path\to\ida" # if not set, the build script will check common locations
    cargo build --release
    ```

## Usage

1. Make sure IDA Pro is properly configured with a valid license.
2. Customize the list of known bad API functions in `conf/rhabdomancer.toml` if needed.
3. Run rhabdomancer as follows:
    ```sh
    rhabdomancer <binary_file>
    ```
   Any existing `.i64` IDB file will be updated; otherwise, a new IDB file will be created.
4. Open the resulting `.i64` IDB file with IDA Pro.
5. Select `View` > `Open subviews` > `Bookmarks`
6. Enjoy your results conveniently collected in an IDA Pro window.

*Note: rhabdomancer also adds comments at marked call locations.*
